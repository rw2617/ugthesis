            You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
            In this study, one of you will be Participant 1 and the other
            Participant 2. Prior to making a decision, you will learn your role,
            which will be randomly assigned.

            There is {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to split. Participant 1 will
            decide how much she or he will retain. Participant 2 can accept or 
            reject this offer. If accepted, Participant 1 will receive the offer,
            and Participant 2 will receive {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} - the offer.
