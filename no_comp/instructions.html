        <p>
            In this study, you will be paired randomly and anonymously 
            in groups of two for 15 rounds. One of you will be the 
            Seller and the other will be the Buyer. This role is 
            randomly assigned and constant throughout the session.
        </p>

        <p>
            Buyers will have a value of either 50 or 150 points, which 
            is randomly assigned every round. The Seller will offer a 
            price, and the Buyer can either accept or reject this price. 
            If the Buyer accepts the price, the Seller will receive the 
            proposed offer and the Buyer will receive 50 minus price or 
            150 minus price. If the Buyer rejects the offer, all 
            participants in the group will receive 0 points for the round.
        </p>

        {{ if 'known_probability' in session.config }}
            <p>
                The Buyer has a value of 50 points with probability 
                50% and a value of 150 points with probability 50%.
