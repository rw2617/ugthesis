        <p>
            In this study, you will be paired randomly and anonymously 
            in groups of 2 for 15 rounds. One of you will be the 
            seller and the other will be the buyer. This role is 
            randomly assigned and constant throughout the session.
        </p>

        <p>
            Buyers will have a value of either 50 or 150 experimental units, which 
            is randomly assigned every round. The seller will offer a price, and 
            the buyer can either accept or reject this price. If the buyer accepts 
            a price, the seller who offered this price will receive the proposed 
            offer and the buyer will receive 50 - price or 150 - price. If the 
            buyer rejects all offers, all participants will receive 0.
        </p>

        {{ if 'known_probability' in session.config }}
            <p>
                The buyer has a value of 50 points with probability 
                50% and a value of 150 points with probability 50%.
