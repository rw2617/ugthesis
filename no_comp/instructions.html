        <p>
            In this study, you will be paired randomly and anonymously with 
            another participant for x rounds. One of you will be the seller and 
            the other will be the buyer. This role is randomly assigned and 
            constant throughout the session.
        </p>

        <p>
            While all sellers have the same cost of 0 experimental units, buyers 
            will have a value of either 50 or 150 experimental units, which is 
            randomly assigned evey round. The seller will offer a price, and the 
            buyer can either accept or reject this price. If the buyer accepts a 
            price, the seller who offered this price will receive the proposed offer
            and the buyer will receive either 50 - price or 150 - price. If the 
            buyer rejects all offers, all participants will receive 0.
        </p>

        {{ if 'known_probability' in session.config }}
            <p>
                You will learn the probability that the buyer has value = 50 or 150
                each round.
