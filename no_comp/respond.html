            The seller offered a price of {{ group.price }}. 
            Because {{ group.price }} is greater than your value,

        <p>
            The seller offered a price of {{ group.price }}. If you accept 
            this offer, this means that you will receive {{ responder_payoff }},
            and the seller will receive {{ group.price }}.

            If you reject this offer, both you and the seller will receive a payoff of 0.
