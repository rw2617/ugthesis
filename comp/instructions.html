        <p>
            In this study, you will be paired randomly and anonymously 
            in groups of three for 15 rounds. Two of you will be the 
            Sellers and the other will be the Buyer. Your role is 
            randomly assigned and constant throughout the session.
        </p>

        <p>
            Buyers will have a value of either 50 or 150 points, which 
            is randomly assigned every round. The Sellers will each offer a 
            price, and the Buyer can accept at most one price. If the Buyer 
            accepts a price, the Seller who offered this price will receive 
            the proposed offer and the Buyer will receive 50 minus price or 
            150 minus price. The other Seller will receive 0 points. If the 
            Buyer rejects all offers, all participants in the group will 
            receive 0 points for the round.
        </p>

                The Buyer has a value of 50 points with probability 
                50% and a value of 150 points with probability 50%.
