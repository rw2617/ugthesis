            In this study, you will be paired randomly and anonymously 
            in groups of 3 for 15 rounds. Two of you will be the 
            sellers and the other will be the buyer. Your role is 
            randomly assigned and constant throughout the session.
        </p>

        <p>
            Buyers will have a value of either 50 or 150 experimental units, which 
            is randomly assigned every round. The sellers will each offer a price, 
            and the buyer can either accept or reject each price. If the buyer 
            accepts a price, the seller who offered this price will receive the 
            proposed offer and the buyer will receive 50 - price or 150 - price. 
            If the buyer rejects all offers, all participants will receive 0.
        </p>

                The buyer has a value of 50 points with probability 
                50% and a value of 150 points with probability 50%.
